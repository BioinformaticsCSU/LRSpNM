# LRSpNM
LRSpNM is a novel matrix completion method, which utilizes Schatten-p norm minimization model combined with Laplacian regularization terms to improve prediction performance in the new drug/target cases. The code in this package implements LRSpNM for drug-target interaction prediction, which is implemented in Matlab2016a.

Description: "run_NR_target.m" demonstrates the experimental result on Nuclear Receptor by LRSpNM under cv_target setting. "LRSpNM.m" is the function of LRSpNM algorithm.
